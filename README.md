Keep moving, just another leetcode repository. Maybe the intention is different with this one. It's not for a leetcode grind or any interview preparation. I'm learning GO and this is just good practice.

## Why GO?

I got bored using python. It was too easy as eveything was provided out of the box and it was slow. GO differs on both of these aspects. And I like to torture myself.

## You like challenges? why don't you use Assembly to write web servers then?

No, I'm not kidding, people have actually written web servers using pure assembly. But yeah I don't feel going as low level as c or c++. Go feels like it has the right level. not too high, not too low.
